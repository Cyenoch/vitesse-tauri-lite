## Installation
- Ready your workspace according to tauri. [Tauri Getting Started](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)

  - **Note:** You only need to install global things such as rust and other os level packages. Any thing related to application itself is already installed and ready for you.

- Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/yooneskh/vite-tauri-template app-name`

- `yarn` or `npm i`

- Modify these files according to your app.
  - `index.html`
  - `package.json`
  - `public/favicon.ico`
  - `src/assets/logo.*`
  - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

## Usage

- `yarn serve` launches vite and you can test and develop your app in the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

- `yarn serve:native` launches vite and configures ynetwork to use tauri for api calls. Use this if you want to test your app in tauri dev mode.

- `yarn serve:tauri` launches tauri in dev mode and you can see your app in tauri window.

- `yarn build` builds web application and packages them with tauri in `src-tauri/target`

- `yarn build:web` only builds the web application and puts it in `./dist` directory. You should not normally want this. Difference of this web app with the one build with normal `yarn build` is that this one uses axios for network calls.
